# Assassin Battle - AI Powered Fighting Game
**Created by Piyush Sharma**

## 🚀 Overview
Assassin Battle is a 2D fighting game built using **Python** and **Pygame**. It features a unique **Predictive AI Opponent** designed to challenge players by learning their combat patterns in real-time.

## 🧠 AI Features (CSE Student Highlight)
This project focuses on **Adaptive Game AI**:
- **Pattern Recognition:** The AI uses a "Move History" dictionary to track player actions.
- **Predictive Logic:** It calculates the probability of the player's next move (Punch, Kick, or Jump) and decides whether to block or counter-attack.
- **Difficulty Scaling:** Uses randomized probability weights based on the selected difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) to simulate human-like reaction times.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Library:** Pygame
- **Web Deployment:** Integrated with `asyncio` and `pygbag` for browser-based play.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Move:** A / D keys
2. **Jump:** W key
3. **Punch:** J key
4. **Kick:** L key
5. **Block:** I key
